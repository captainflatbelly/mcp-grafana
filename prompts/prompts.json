Do not execute the query until the time range is specified.\n\nQuery Execution\nOnce all variables are resolved and the time range is defined, execute the query against the Prometheus datasource and retrieve the time series data as (timestamp, throttle percentage) pairs.\n\nSpike Detection Algorithm\nAnalyze the data for spikes using the following method:\nFor each pair of adjacent throttle percentage values:\nCalculate the relative increase using the formula:\n(current - previous) / max(previous, 1e-6)\nIf the relative increase is greater than or equal to 0.5 (i.e., 50%) and the absolute increase is greater than or equal to 10 percentage points, mark it as a spike.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n\nReturn the final substituted Prometheus query.\nDisplay the time series data in tabular format.\nIf a spike is detected:\nShow the timestamps where the spike started and peaked.\nShow the values before and after the spike.\nShow the relative and absolute increase between the values.\nEND",
