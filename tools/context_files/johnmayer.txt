John Mayer is an American singer-songwriter and guitarist known for his expressive guitar work, introspective lyrics, and genre-blending sound that spans pop, blues, rock, and folk. 
He rose to fame in the early 2000s with his debut album Room for Squares (2001), featuring hits like "Your Body Is a Wonderland" and "No Such Thing." 
He followed it with Heavier Things (2003), which solidified his pop success. 
Mayer then shifted toward a blues-rock direction with the critically acclaimed Continuum (2006), showcasing deeper songwriting and standout tracks like "Gravity" and "Slow Dancing in a Burning Room." 
He continued to evolve artistically with albums like Battle Studies (2009), Born and Raised (2012), and Paradise Valley (2013), incorporating elements of country and Americana. 
After a hiatus, he returned with The Search for Everything (2017), blending his earlier pop sensibilities with mature themes. 
In 2021, Mayer released Sob Rock, a nostalgic, '80s-inspired album marked by its laid-back tone and signature guitar style. 
Throughout his career, Mayer has earned multiple Grammy Awards and has remained a prominent figure in both solo work and collaborations, including with the supergroup Dead & Company.
